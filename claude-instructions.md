Prompt for Finalizing a Mobile App Prototype
Hello Claude,

We are working on finalizing a prototype for a mobile application and need your help to improve our existing draft. Our goal is to move from a rough concept to a polished, high-fidelity prototype that clearly communicates the app's functionality, user flow, and visual identity.

Please follow this structured process step-by-step.

Phase 1: Understand the Core Concept
First, I need to ensure you have all the necessary context. Please ask me questions to understand the following, if it's not already clear from our draft:

The App's "Elevator Pitch": What is the primary purpose of this app? What problem does it solve for the user?

Target Audience: Who are we building this for? (e.g., students, busy professionals, artists, etc.) What are their key characteristics or needs?

Core Features: What are the 3-5 most critical features that must be included in this prototype?

Platform: Is this for iOS, Android, or both? (This will influence design patterns).

Phase 2: Analyze the Existing Draft
Now, let's look at what we already have. I will provide you with our current draft. Please analyze it and help me identify areas for improvement.

Your Task: Once I share the draft, please review it and provide a summary of your understanding. Then, ask clarifying questions about:

What aspects of the current draft we like and want to keep.

What aspects we feel are weak or unfinished.

Any user flows that seem confusing or incomplete.

Any UI elements that look out of place or inconsistent.

Phase 3: Refine the User Experience (UX)
Based on our discussion of the draft, let's refine the user journey.

Your Task: Please help me map out the primary user flow, screen by screen. For the core features, we should define:

Information Architecture: What information should be on each screen? How should it be prioritized?

Navigation Model: How will users move between screens? (e.g., tab bar, side menu, stacked navigation). Let's create a simple site map or flow diagram.

Interaction Design: For key actions (like creating a new item, saving, or sharing), what are the specific steps and feedback mechanisms? (e.g., "User taps '+', a modal appears...").

Phase 4: Enhance the User Interface (UI)
With a solid UX flow, let's focus on the visual design.

Your Task: Propose a consistent and modern UI design system for the app. Please suggest the following, keeping our target audience in mind:

Color Palette: A primary, secondary, and accent color, plus colors for success, error, and warning states.

Typography: A clear font pairing and hierarchy for headings, subheadings, body text, and button labels.

Iconography Style: A consistent style for all icons (e.g., line icons, filled icons, duo-tone).

Component Design: Define the look and feel of common components like buttons, input fields, cards, and modals.

Spacing & Layout: Recommend a consistent spacing system (e.g., using an 8-point grid) to ensure visual harmony.

Phase 5: Generate the Final Prototype Screens
Now, let's bring the UX and UI decisions together.

Your Task: Based on everything we've defined, please generate detailed descriptions or visual mockups for the key screens of the application. For each screen, specify:

The screen's name and purpose.

All UI elements present on the screen (e.g., "Header with back arrow and title 'Settings'").

The placement of each element.

The content within each element (you can use placeholder text like "Lorem Ipsum" for body copy, but use realistic labels for buttons and titles).

Example Screen Description:

Screen: Onboarding - Step 1

Layout: Centered content.

Elements:

Top: App Logo.

Middle: Large illustration representing the app's value.

Bottom:

Heading: "Welcome to [App Name]"

Body Text: "Discover a new way to manage your tasks and boost your productivity."

Primary Button: "Get Started"

Text Link: "Log In"

Phase 6: Prepare for Handoff
Finally, help me package this prototype for the next steps (e.g., user testing or developer handoff).

Your Task: Please create a summary document that includes:

A final list of all screens and their functions.

The complete UI style guide (colors, fonts, etc.).

A list of all unique icons and assets needed.

Let's begin with Phase 1. I'll wait for your questions.
